# Metaprogramming: writing code that manipulates language constructs at runtime
# (language constructs = variables, classes, methods, etc.)
# Therefore, a programming language must have concrete language constructs at runtime
# Languages like C have a compile time and runtime, where language constructs are like ghosts @ runtime.
# Ruby has no compile time at all and most constructs are available @ runtime
